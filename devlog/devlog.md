## Week of June 18 2017
#### WEEK GOALS
* Gather project requirements
* Prepare model prototype

#### OVERVIEW
The first week of development will be focused on better understanding and defining its purpose, requirements, structure and development schedule. This will week I will also make a rough prototype of the base triple engine that will eventually create an ontology for the players on Steam.

#### NOTES

**Purpose**
SAGE aims to create a 'living-breathing' ontology of all Steam players that groups them by their gaming behavior. All parties involved benefit from this analysis:

* Steam gains a new way of making recommendations to players- purchasing and non.
* Publishers and business-related parties may see sales increase through targeted advertising.
* Developers may gain insight into the organic communities around their games.
* Players can find each other by their similarity metrics, thus creating a more vibrant community.

**Requirements**
* API SERVICE
* SCRAPE / RDF STORE SERVER
* SEMANTICS ENGINE
* RECOMMENDATIONS ALGORITHM

**Structure**

**Schedule**
